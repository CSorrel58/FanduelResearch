-[My Tableau Public Profile](https://public.tableau.com/profile/clinton.sorrel#!/) which contains the various dashboards I have created.

### NBA

My first project and the one that currently has the most facets is the data I've scraped for NBA Basketball Player's daily fantasy performance. While the Tableau story can be found on my profile, you can also find it [here.](https://public.tableau.com/profile/clinton.sorrel#!/vizhome/FanduelScores/NBAFanduelValue2020)

### NFL

I am currently working on a similar project for the NFL and am giving live updates. The data is accurate through Week 3 and will be updated all year.
