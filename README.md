# FanduelResearch
My personal research project on player Fanduel scores relative to their price. Each Zip contains work for a different Sports League, with the league name in the file name.

The CSV file is the information for each player's performance and their price for every game they played through the season. This information was originally pulled from http://rotoguru1.com but I converted it to a .csv for ease of use and to avoid constantly requesting the information.

The Jupyter notebooks contain:
-"Import_and_Clean_Fanduel":my efforts to clean the data and mege all of the games into one dataframe I could then use to look at player value.
-"Manipulating Cleaned Fanduel": My efforts to use the cleaned frame to measure player value

I also created some visualizations using these frames in Tableau Public and have published them here: https://public.tableau.com/profile/clinton.sorrel#!/?newProfile=&activeTab=0
